# SV Contributing Guide

## Workflow

We follow the standard fork-based workflow:

1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork locally.
3. **Create a new branch** for your change:
   `git checkout -b your-feature-name`
4. **Commit and push** your changes to your branch.
5. **Open a pull request** from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository.

Please keep your pull requests focused to feature or issue. Focused smaller changes are easier to review and faster to merge.

## Preparing

This is a monorepo, meaning the repo holds multiple packages. It requires the use of [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). You can [install pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) with:

```sh
npm i -g pnpm
```

_(Optional)_ For running certain packages and tests locally you will need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker).
Linux users, you will have to ensure 'sudo' is not required. See [docker post install](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

`pnpm` commands run in the project's root directory will run on all sub-projects. You can checkout the code and install the dependencies with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sveltejs/cli.git
cd cli
pnpm i
```

## Build and run

To build the project and all packages. Run the 'build' script:

```sh
# from root of project
pnpm build
```

This outputs into /packages/PACKAGE/dist/.

Run the 'cli' package:

```sh
pnpm sv
```

Run build with watch mode:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

## Testing

For each add-on we have integration tests setup. These install the deps, build the app, run the dev server and then run a few small snippets against the add-on to see if the changes introduced by the add-on are working as expected.

Tests are split into projects: `cli`, `core`, `sv-utils`, `addons`, `create`, `migrate`. **Always run tests by project** for faster feedback:

```sh
pnpm test --project migrate            # Migrate tests
pnpm test --project core               # Core tests
pnpm test --project create             # Project creation tests
pnpm test --project addons             # Add-on tests
pnpm test --project sv-utils           # sv-utils tests

pnpm test --project addons eslint      # Just eslint add-on tests
pnpm build && pnpm test --project cli  # CLI tests
```

Run with vitest ui for interactive debugging:

```sh
pnpm test:ui --project cli
```

Run all tests (slow, typically for CI):

```sh
pnpm test
```

### Debugging

Example of how to debug an addon failing test. Once you run the test command, you will have a directory in `.test-output` with the test id. A good starting point is to `cd` into the failing tests dir and run the app directly. E.g.:

```sh
pnpm test --project addons better-auth   # Run the failing test first

# Each test generates a standalone app in .test-output
cd packages/sv/.test-output/addons/better-auth/default-kit-ts

# Option 1: Run dev server for interactive debugging
pnpm dev
# Open http://localhost:5173 and use browser DevTools to inspect

# Option 2: Build and preview (matches production behavior)
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

Using dev mode with browser DevTools is often the fastest way to debug UI issues - you can inspect network requests, console errors, and the DOM directly. Once you identify the issue, fix it in the addon source (`packages/sv/src/addons/[addon].ts`) and re-run the test.

### Update snapshots

Some snapshots are testing the output of `sv` directly from the generated binary. They are located in `packages/sv/src/cli/tests/snapshots`. Make sure to generate a new binary before updating these snapshots.

In one command:

```sh
pnpm build && pnpm test:ui --project cli
# Press `u` when prompted to update snapshots.
```

## Style Guide

### Coding style

There are a few guidelines we follow:

- Ensure `pnpm lint` and `pnpm check` pass. You can run `pnpm format` to format the code
- linting

```sh
# from root of project
pnpm lint
```

- formatting

```sh
# from root of project
pnpm format
```

- type checking

```sh
# from root of project
pnpm check
```

## svelte-migrate

To run svelte-migrate locally:

```sh
# from root of project
node ./packages/migrate/bin.js
```

## Deprecation

Public APIs cannot be changed in a minor release since it is a breaking change. Instead, the old behaviour is marked as deprecated until the next major version, at which point they can be removed.

### How to deprecate

1. **Add `@deprecated` JSDoc** on the type/function - IDEs will show strikethrough:

   ```ts
   /** @deprecated use `newThing()` instead. */
   ```

2. **Emit a runtime warning** (for functions/methods) using `svDeprecated()` from `core/deprecated.ts`. Warns once per message:

   ```ts
   svDeprecated('use `newThing()` instead of `oldThing()`');
   ```

3. **Keep the old behavior working** - the deprecated API should still function correctly, just with a warning.

### Before a major release

Search for `svDeprecated` and `@deprecated` to find and remove all deprecated APIs.

## Generating changelogs

Here is the command to generate a change set:

```sh
# from root of project
pnpm changeset

# select package
# choose the level of change (patch, minor, major)
# write a summary like:
#   feat(mdsvex): enable .svx .md extensions by default
#   fix(vitest): add browser testing to vitest config
#   chore(cli): update addons dependencies
```

- Do not edit `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` manually.

## Updating dependencies

Run `pnpm update-deps` to recursively update the dependencies of all addons and create templates.
After that run `pnpm update -r --latest` to recursively update all dependencies of package.json files to their latest version.
